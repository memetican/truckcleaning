Our team of professionally trained and experienced owner operators are extensively trained in all aspects of vehicle valet service. We are dedicated to providing you with the most convenient and professional service possible.

### Keep your fleet beautiful & well protected

Protect your fleet, as one of your greatest assets - and ensure that your beautifully clean trucks are giving the best possible representation of you and your company.

Our valet services include a full interior and exterior clean; carpet wash and upholstery shampoo; alloy and chrome polishing; dressage of all vinyl surface; and hoodlining. After that kind of detailing, pride in your fleet is just a give-in.

_We are all about taking care of your assets in a way that works for you._

### full Mobile Valet Services for trucks & fleets

**The Truck Cleaning Company provides the only mobile truck wash in New Zealand.**

Traditional truck washes require drivers to take their truck to a physical location, costing companies in fuel, 2-4 hours of paid time and downtime for the driver, road user charges, and more. The Truck Cleaning Company offers an alternative, coming to you and efficiently hand washing your trucks to an impeccable standard.

We operate with a 'mobile' service which means that your trucks can still perform at their optimum during business hours, saving you time and money. We offer a premium head-to-toe service for all large fleet vehicles in the Auckland area from Albany to Pukekohe. 

We can come to you at any time of the day or night, on weekdays or weekends. The only one of its kind in New Zealand, our mobile cleaning service saves you time, money, and hassle.

A **Full Valet "SuperWash"** for each truck includes;

*   Interior & exterior clean
*   Carpet wash & upholstery shampoo
*   Alloy & chrome polishing

### NO MESS. NO STRESS.

At The Truck Cleaning Company we pride ourselves in our world class service to deliver the highest quality in valet expertise. 

### FULL SANITIZATION SERVICE

We provide full sanitization for your truck and fleet vehicles with exceptional service for value.

We will clean your trucks & fleets at any site of your choice, _anytime_. This is ideal for fleets that are parked up at specific times in the day or nights on both weekdays and weekends.

### Environmentally-Friendly Wastewater Removal

Protecting New Zealand's environment is important to us. That is why we bring everything we need from power to water and shelter; PLUS take everything away again, including the water! 

_We are proud to be one of the few approved waste water removal approved operators nationally._
